  Title: On Quantum Theory
  Text: The walls within this place reminds me of Quantum Superposition, but this
    is on a scale nothing like it. The walls seems to have some kind of intelligence,
    they react to how you traverse them. I'm sure there's a rational explaination
    for all of this. I just... need to... make sense of it...
