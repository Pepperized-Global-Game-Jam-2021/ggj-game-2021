  Title: Letting Go
  Text: One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go. We try to fight back but
    the darkness in our minds so often tries to consume us just before we find the
    power to be free.  Despite that, it is important to remember-- No darkness lasts
    forever, and even then there is still the moon and the stars in the sky somewhere
    above us.  I was lost, but now I am found and I am free.
