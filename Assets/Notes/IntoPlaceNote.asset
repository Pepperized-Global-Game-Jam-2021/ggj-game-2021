  Title: Fall into Place
  Text: "I expected to know where I\u2019d be going. I thought once I\u2019m there
    I\u2019d figure it out and it will all fall into place. Instead I am as lost
    as when I started\u2026 Is it my fault? Have I done something wrong? Made a wrong
    turn? It\u2019s so lonely\u2026"
