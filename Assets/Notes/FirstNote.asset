  Title: The Walls Themselves
  Text: If you're trapped here like me, let me give you some advice, find notes like
    this and the walls themselves move and change. Maybe if I manage to find enough
    I can get out of this godforsaken place. I'm leaving some around so that others
    can find a way out too, please let someone know I'm trapped. Also, make sure
    you burn this, the damn fireplace doesn't warm you up at all unless you burn
    one of these notes.
