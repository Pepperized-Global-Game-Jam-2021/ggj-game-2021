  Title: Leap of Faith
  Text: Darkness blocks my path, I can't walk forward anymore.  Panic flows into
    my mind like the tide upon the shore.  Put my head in my hands and ground myself
    again. Count to three, be sure to breathe, and tell myself it's not the end..
    Close my eyes and then I'll find..  I can navigate the darkness in my mind but
    I must keep my ears open..
