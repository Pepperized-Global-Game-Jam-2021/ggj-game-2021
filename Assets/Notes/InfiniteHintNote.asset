  Title: Exhausted
  Text: I am mentally exhuasted, I don't know how long I'll last I run as far as
    I possibly can to escape from my past. I scream in exasperation as I begin to
    find the paths with no obstacles lead me nowhere in my mind.  Turning back there
    is a door that was never there before.
