  Title: The Final Stretch
  Text: The darkness I've created weighs me down.  I realise that it's been so long
    since I've felt the warmth or felt anything at all for that matter. I've avoided
    the pain, but at what cost?  I've forgotten the way it feels when the sun envelops
    my skin, and forgotten the way it sounds when the wind hits the trees.  I've
    protected myself because I've been afraid, but it dawns on me.. The only thing
    I have to fear is fear itself and it's time escape from its suffocating grip.
    Just one last stretch..
